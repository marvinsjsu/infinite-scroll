## Project Description

This project was built with HTML, CSS, and plain JavaScript to manipulate
the DOM. It also uses the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) and uses the scroll position relative to the page height to trigger image fetching.  The images
come from [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/developers).
